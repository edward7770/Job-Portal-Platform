The second step in the deployment process is to upload the configured Bullhorn Career Portal release package to a website hosting service. Most website hosts support uploading files via a web-based interface, usually referred to as a `Control Panel` or `cPanel`. The following guide walks through the process of uploading the Bullhorn Career Portal package to a website host via a website host's control panel:

***

**1. Log into your Website Host**

Log into your hosting account in a browser using credentials provided when you purchased and configured your website.

***

**2. Access the Website Host Control Panel**

Once logged into your hosting account, search for "Control Panel", "cPanel", "Uploading Site Content" or similar, using the provider's search function or support documentation. Navigate to your account's control panel as instructed by provider documentation.

***

**3. Create a Directory to Host Bullhorn Career Portal Content**

Using your provider's control panel interface, navigate to the root directory of your website and create a directory named `careerportal` or similar.

The directory will will act as the root path to the Bullhorn Career Portal. For example, if your site is `www.example.com`, creating a directory `careerportal` would result in the Bullhorn Career Portal being hosted at `www.example.com/careerportal`.

***

**4. Upload Bullhorn Career Portal package to the Control Panel Directory**

Navigate to the newly created directory in the provider's control panel interface. Upload all directory and file contents from the location of your extracted and configured Bullhorn Career Portal package via the `Download and Configure` step, using commands that control panel provides. When the upload is complete, the control panel's contents should be identical with local directory contents.

***

**5. Test your Bullhorn Career Portal**

Navigate to your website in a browser, paying careful attention to ensure that the Bullhorn Career Portal control panel root directory is included in the URL; for example, `http://www.example.com/careerportal`. Verify the portal is displaying jobs published via the Bullhorn ATS/CRM JobCast screen.

***

**That's it!** Your configured Bullhorn Career Portal is uploaded and ready for use!
