> _`Note: If you have previously installed a similar plugin, you will first need to delete the plugin, then install this one to ensure you have the most up to date version of The Bullhorn Career Portal in your WordPress environment.`_

There are **two methods** to install the Plugin. **Method 1 is simpler** and functions as an out-of-the-box portal. **Method 2 allows for customization** but requires the download, modification, and upload of the files, rather than just adding the Plugin.

## Method 1

1.  Navigate to your WordPress admin page.

The page is usually located at `[wordpress root]/wp-admin/`

2. Under Plugins, click **Add New**.
